# Izly

## Project goal

The goal of this project was to pick an existing application on the Application Store, one that I previously spotted as uneffecient or improvable, and improve some of its features.

## What is Izly and why did I choose this application?

I was at the time a full time student. So during my day to day life I was using several mobile applications, whether it was for consulting my emails, or booking a time slot for a sport session.
But the application I was using the most was by far Izly.

Izly is a french application developed for students mostly, but also for all the university staff working on campus.
The app enables to access information regarding the life on campus and to pay for food, drinks or meals either at vending machines or at the university restaurant. Usually linked to the students' card, it key features are:
- Consult money balance for student account
- Top up your account
- Consult payments and top-ups history
- Wire money to personal bank account
- Pay at the restaurant
- Manage your account
- Consult campus news

The reason I chose this application is because as a user I spotted a lot of areas of improvement when using the application, especially regarding the user experience.
