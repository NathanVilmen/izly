# Izly

## 0. Project goal

The goal of this project was to pick an existing application on the Application Store, one that I previously spotted as uneffecient or improvable, and improve some of its features.

## 1. What is Izly and why did I choose this application?

I was at the time a full time student. So during my day to day life I was using several mobile applications, whether it was for consulting my emails, or booking a time slot for a sport session.
But the application I was using the most was by far Izly.

Izly is a french application developed for students mostly, but also for all the university staff working on campus.
The app enables to access information regarding the life on campus and to pay for food, drinks or meals either at vending machines or at the university restaurant. Usually linked to the students' card, it key features are:
- Consult money balance for student account
- Top up your account
- Consult payments and top-ups history
- Wire money to personal bank account
- Pay at the restaurant
- Manage your account
- Consult campus news

The reason I chose this application is because as a user I spotted a lot of areas of improvement when using the application, especially regarding the user experience.

### A. The connexion page

In this connnexion page I clearly identifiied potential for more clarity. To me it was not aesthetic so I wanted to make it clearer and nice to see. <br/>
It as too important as the first page of the application not to reshape it.

### B. The navigation menu

This is the main page of the application, displaying the student account balance. <br/>
The navigation menu was not "user friendly" enough for me; it was not clear for me what menu item to go to for certain actions. <br/>
One page for balance, one to top up and one to pay is just too much. I wanted to combine the main page and give the ability to pay from this page.

### C. Unintuitive and unnecessary actions

It is here in the <b>Plus</b> button that we could see the sign off option, at the bottom of the actions list. I wanted it to be more accessible. <br/>

Same here, to manage our credit cards, we need to go to <b>Plus</b>, then <b>Preferences</b>, then <b>Manage my cards</b>. What a mess!

### D. Hidden buttons

The last screenshot illlustrates well the hidden <b>Back</b> buttons, small and grey on a blue background. Just impossible to see on a mobile screen. <br/>
